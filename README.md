# Machine-Leaning-User-Interface-WEKA-
Prediction and Visualization for Agricultural via IoT using WEKA api.

Step 1: Download and install Eclipse or other open source integrated development environment (IDE) from the internet.
Eclipse link : http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/


Step 2: Download and install latest Weka (data mining software) from Weka official website.
Basically , we will using machine learning algorithm from Weka and Weka is java based program.
Weka link: https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html


Step 3: Download these two java library which are JCommon and MySQL Connector.
Basically, JCommon library is for graph visualization and MySQL Connector is to integrate our interface with database.
JCommon link: http://www.jfree.org/jcommon/download/
MySQL Connector link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html


Step 4: After done with the installation of all software and library that have been mentioned in step 1 until 3, first and foremost you need to open Eclipse.


Step 5: Create a new project and named it as FYP.


Step 6: Create a new class and named it as UserInterface.


Step 7: Add Weka ,JCommon and MySQL Connector library inside your project by following this step.
o	Right click on your project (FYP) and select build path and under build path select configure build path.
o	Select libraries tab and click add external JARs.
o	Find where your put your Weka folder (usually in C:\Program Files\Weka-3-8) and select weka.jar file and added it into your Eclipse.
o	Do the same thing for JCommon and MySQL Connector.


Step 8: Now you can start coding to build your own machine learning user interface.
